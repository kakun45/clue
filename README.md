## todo:
- mark `set card=player` and `player=y` during the same turn

(VS typing 2ce player has the card "Dave=y" and "set card Dave=y" let it figure out only one entry of either)
- add an "undo" function
- while playing save it into a file, and add reload from .json
- propose whose turn it is? unless someone won't make it into a room
